Changes over base 7 are better routing (using System.Routing, then new-ish and a lot more painful than semi-magical attribute routing now available at time of writing, v13.5 2016), and the replacement of the CKEditor with the NicEditor, which was much more lightweight (though again, nowhere near as lightweight as content-editable on raw divs).
