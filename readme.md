Back to ASP.NET, developed with much more expertise than before thanks to heavy work in the same domain at work at the time. The visual style was also very distinct, inspired by Deus Ex HR (all in black and gold). It used a custom font (Jura) and had a distinct backround animation using HTML5 canvas. While all fun and dandy, it also used a very distinct storage system, Azure Search. The index of the free tier of this search service was 50mb, large enough to contain all posts in the archive, so I wired it up :) Search as a site function was therefore very fast, but a number of other features did not work so well (roughly due to limitations with document-based storage in general).
