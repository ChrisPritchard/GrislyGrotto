<b>Frontend:</b> WCF REST Service, HTML5 frontend using JsRender templates and Typescript

<b>Backend:</b> Azure Hosting, Azure SQL Server

<b>Dev Tool:</b> Visual Studio 2012

The first shift to Azure. Previously the site had been on a hosting service called OpenHost. With the move to Azure I also moved to Azure SQL, as I couldn't work out how to get SQL Server CE to work on it (figured it out three years later).
Also the first use of TypeScript.
