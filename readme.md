The primary change in technology between this version and 5 is the introduction of 'enterprise best practices', things like inversion of control, dependency injection etc. All done using the Enterprise Library (and container's like Microsoft's Unity). My knowledge of these techniques was enthusiastic but not deep, and they are in retrospect really not needed for a site this small. Ah well, I am sure I enjoyed myself :D
