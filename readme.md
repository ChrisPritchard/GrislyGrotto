This was the first, and possibly last, version of the site that wasn't based on C#. NodeJS! A pure Javascript site, through and through :) Of course, painful to develop - no TypeScript (at the time), poor JS support for SQL databases etc (still was using Azure SQL Server). Still, a leap of faith (at the time).
