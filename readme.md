## Release 8.6

<b>Release Date:</b> Possibly 23rd February, 2011

<b>Release Post:</b> <a href="http://grislygrotto.azurewebsites.net/p/the-fixening">The Fixening</a>

<b>Frontend:</b> Site Handler, XSLT Transform with AJAX / JavaScript

<b>Backend:</b> SQLite

Seems to be improvements and bug fixes over 8. Not too sure why it warrented its own version number/release folder, or why that number is .6 (when .5 in the past and future represents a more substantial change).
