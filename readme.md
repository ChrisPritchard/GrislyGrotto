## Release 7 to 7.2

<b>Release Date:</b> 6th January, 2010

<b>Release Post:</b> <a href="http://grislygrotto.azurewebsites.net/p/presenting-7">Presenting 7</a>

<b>Frontend:</b> Site Handler, XSLT Transform with AJAX / JavaScript

<b>Backend:</b> SQLite

<b>Dev Tool:</b> Visual Studio 2008

A return to old style development, enschewing MVC. However I believe the JavaScript involvement in this site is more than any of the previous versions. This version also marks the first instance of SQLite usage. The release was quite painful and rushed however, and as such there were two more subsequent releases (7.1 and 7.2) over the following days.
