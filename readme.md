# Release 15

__Release Date:__ TBC

__Release Post:__ [Grisly Grotto 15.0](http://grislygrotto.azurewebsites.net/)

__Frontend:__ F# on .NET Core 2.1 with [Giraffe](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp)

__Backend:__ Azure SQL Server

__Dev Tool:__ Visual Studio Code

The first version of GG to not use C# or JS in its construction, instead using my new favourite language, F#.
It uses the Giraffe framework, and therefore is still built on top of the excellent ASP.NET Core and .NET Core 2.1 Runtime.
