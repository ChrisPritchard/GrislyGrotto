# Release 16

__Release Date:__ 20th June 2019

__Release Post:__ [Grisly Grotto 16.0](http://grislygrotto.nz/)

__Frontend:__ F# on .NET Core 2.2 with [Giraffe](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp) and [HeyRed's Markdown](https://github.com/hey-red/Markdown)

__Data Store:__ SQLite

__Dev Tool:__ Visual Studio 2019

The second version to use F#, and the first in a while not to be hosted on Azure. Instead, in another first, it is running on Linux on a server I run at home, via a static IP and domain I have registered with my provider.
The other major difference is that instead of using content-editable as the last bunch of versions have used, v16 instead uses a markdown editor which is converted to HTML via an external project.
