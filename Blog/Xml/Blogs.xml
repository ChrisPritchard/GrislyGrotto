  <blog title="Welcome" author="Christopher" date="2006-06-16T02:29:41Z">Blog the first.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hello reader, and welcome to my blog. My name is Christopher Pritchard (you may call me Chris) and at the time of writing&lt;br /&gt;
I am 21, living in New Zealand and working as a programmer. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This site was constructed for three purposes: first, I wanted a blog. You cant be a proper geek without a blog.&lt;br /&gt;
Second, Ive never constructed a site completely from scratch, with forums, authentication and a blog section.&lt;br /&gt;
And finally this site houses resources and discussions between my closest firends on issues ranging from ####&lt;br /&gt;
to ####, and of course ####. However if you are not counted in that number then as far as viewing&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
these articles go youre shit out of luck, as we say in New Zealand.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In anycase enjoy my ramblings. If you wish to contact me, my email address is at the base&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
of the page (be sure to check out those links too).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;
Chris. </blog>
