## Stretch / Possible ideas

- next post / prev post: can't see where this would be needed, even though the current site has it
- themes, like the current site has. was always a bit messy, not sure it added much even if fun
- rss feed
- click enlarge images?
- share on other socs?
- social media links (linkedin, tryhackme, github etc) in more prominent locations
- categories?
- chatgpt integration lolol. could be used to get categories from a post
- last 10 post headings?
- maybe some command handling on the editor? e.g. ctrl+b for bold, a button to add a link etc: these could just insert the requisite markdown characters
- automatic webp image conversion: https://github.com/image-rs/image/blob/master/README.md
