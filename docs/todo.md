- themes, like the current site has. was always a bit messy, not sure it added much even if fun
- rss feed
- click enlarge images?
- share on other socs?
- social media links (linkedin, tryhackme, github etc) in more prominent locations
- categories?
- chatgpt integration lolol. could be used to get categories from a post
- last 10 post headings?
- user details display
