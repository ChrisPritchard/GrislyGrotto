        My name is Christopher Pritchard, and I work as a senior Information Security professional at an remote-first company. Aside from infosec, most of my career has been in Software Development and Solution Architecture roles. Going on twenty years now, phew.
    </p>
    <p>
        Enough about work though! Outside of my life as a wage slave, my hobbies are writing (I do <a href="https://nanowrimo.org">NaNoWriMo</a> every year, lots of fun), gaming (on PC, more or less exclusively), coding (including fun comps like <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a>) and hacking (CTFs like on <a href="https://tryhackme.com/p/Aquinas/">TryHackMe</a> - nothing <i>illegal</i>). I also do a lot of personal projects, such as the one you are looking at now - more can be found on my GitHub profile linked below.
    </p>
    <p>
        Oh, I am also a happily married man with a young daughter. I also have a small dog who for some fucking reason won't shut up whenever a door slams.

    <h2>About the Grisly Grotto</h2>
    <p>
        The Grisly Grotto is the personal blogging site of myself and Pete. The name comes from a computer game, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(video_game)">Quake</a> (from 1996!) which was a formative game in my childhood. Specifically the fourth level of the first 'episode' in Quake, <a href="https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/E1M4:_the_Grisly_Grotto">E1M4: 'The Grisly Grotto'</a>. I don't know; I liked the name, and so its stuck for the past fourteen years. I can't actually remember why I initially chose it ðŸ¤”.</p>

        The first version of GG went live back in 2006. I had always wanted to have a blog, and thought having one was part of what made someone a developer.
        More importantly though, while I had learned a few web development skills (in ASP.NET Webforms back then), my day job did not afford me the opportunity to 'do it all': design, development, hosting, bug fixing etc. 
        So GG was born, a web application of manageable scope that allowed me to fully practice my craft. 
        While I have outgrown whats required to make something as simple as blog, it still serves as a periodic 'zen' meditation: rebuilding the same structure over and over again, in the latest JS framework, database architecture or server-side technology that takes my fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
        So far there have been 18 versions, made in a variety of languages and techniques. Earlier versions used ASP.NET Webforms, some used XSLT transforms for markup, some were pure client side javascript and there was a one-off version in NodeJS, though most have been partly or entirely .NET code. 
        Multiple design frameworks have been used, but mostly I have done the CSS entirely myself for practice. At least six different data storage solutions (databases or otherwise) have been used, and multiple different hosting solutions including paid hosting, Azure, AWS and even for a few versions on a Raspberry PI 3B+ in a desk drawer.
    </p>
    <p>
        I expect there to be many more iterations as I seek to learn new things going forward.
    </p>
    <h2>About v18 specifically</h2>
    <p>
        v18 is the first version to be built in the language Rust, using the actix-web framework, tera for templates and a sqlite database. The previous version of the site was in Go, the two versions before that in F#, and C# (and once in Node) for the versions before <i>that</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Why use Rust? Its my current favourite language, migrating off Go. I like its speed, its size compiled (and the static binaries, which I also loved Go for) and the advanced features of the language, including its functional base which gells fondly with my F# experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hosting wise, the site is running on Fly.IO. For its size, this is free for me even with a custom domain and persistent database. All hail Fly.IO! Its images are stored in S3, again for less than I'd ever notice.
    </p>
    <p>
        The source code for the site is <a href="https://github.com/ChrisPritchard/GrislyGrotto">here</a>, do with as you will.</p>
    <p>
        Cheers.
