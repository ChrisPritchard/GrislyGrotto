The code is good, and in place, but the implementation of the database has proved to be...problematic. Support is helping me with this. Ironically one of the features of the old site was an entirely xml based database that neatly circumvented these issues but, alas, the sheer amount of blogs (800+ and rising) has led xml files to be unfeasible for data storage. Still all should be good soon, please have patience.</font></div></body></html>
