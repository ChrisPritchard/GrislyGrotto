    <h2>About me</h2>

    <p>
        My name is Christopher Pritchard, and I work as a senior-level software developer and architect in Wellington, New Zealand. At time of writing (June, 2015), I am a (the?) Principal Software Engineer at Wynyard Group, Wellington. Formerly for a (long) time I was a developer/solutions architect at Provoke Solutions Wellington. In my role we develop on the Microsoft .NET stack. Generally this involves full end to end development of websites, processing software and mobile applications for businesses and government departments.
    </p>

    <p>
        I have been working in the IT industry for ten years now (again, at time of writing :), primary in development or development related roles. While management and now solution design have been part of my responsibilities, I always prefer to stay close to the code. I think I'm pretty good at what I do :D
    </p>

    <p>
        Outside of work, my hobbies are writing (successive participant/winner in the NaNoWriMo competition each year I'm proud to say), and gaming (on PCs). I also do a lot of personal projects, such as the one you are looking at now.

    <h2>About the Grisly Grotto</h2>

    <p>
        The first version of GG went live back in 2006. I had always wanted to have a blog, and thought it practically a requirement to be in the tech industry at the time. More importantly though, while I had learned much of the craft of web development (in ASP.NET webforms back then, haha) my day job did not afford me the opportunity to 'do it all': design, development, hosting, bug fixing etc. So GG was born, a web application of manageable scope that allowed me to fully practice my craft.
    </p>

    <p>
        While the site serves as a day to day journal of the irreverant things and thoughts myself and good friend Peter Coleman choose to put down, its primary purpose for me has been as a test bench; a way to learn some new technology or technique in a much more elaborate version of 'Hello World'.
    </p>

    <p>
        So far there have been 13 versions, each one distinctive. Earlier versions used ASP.NET webforms, some used XSLT transforms for markup, some were pure client side javascript; the last version was in NodeJS. Multiple design frameworks have been used, although mostly I have done the CSS entirely myself for practice. At least six different data storage solutions (data bases or otherwise) have been used, and multiple different hosting solutions before it ended up here, on Azure in v11/12/13. I expect there to be many more iterations as I seek to learn new things going forward.
    </p>

    <p>
        There is also a companion site <a href="http://grislygrotto-gallery.azurewebsites.net/">here</a>.
        This 'gallery' is just a convenient place for me to showcase tech demos - its a static html site otherwise that I manually update.
    </p>

    <h2>About v13 specifically</h2>

    <p>
        The most distinctive thing about v13 is obviously the background animation, and to a lesser extent the colour scheme. Yes, I know this might be heresy in web design :) Please note I have tried to mitigate distraction somewhat by applying a background to posts where the animation is hidden. However I wanted to experiment with HTML5 canvas as a background to a site, and to be honest just wanted to try something distinctive. Too much of the web seems flat and pastel these days, I wanted to create something memorable. In this instance, I was inspired by the announcement of Deus Ex Mankind Divided and so built something in that theme.
    </p>

    <p>
        Apart from that, the site is a stock standard ASP.NET MVC5 project, with an emphasis on a clean code base and neat HTML output.
        CSS is based on the excellent <a href="http://getskeleton.com/">Skeleton CSS framework</a>, with the custom font used being the free font <a href="http://www.dafont.com/jura.font">Jura</a>.
        For JS, I use <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">Knockout JS</a> where appropriate and write all site-specific JS using <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/">Typescript</a>.
        One further quirk is that I abandoned a database with this build; instead, given how small the content of the site is (3500 posts is still less than 10mb serialised to json),
        I leveraged the free tier of the new <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/search/">Azure Search</a> service and stuck the entire db into the search index.
        It works surprisingly well, with backups made by serialising the index and saving the json file into <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/">Azure Blob Storage</a>
        (which I also use for image hosting). Clean.
    </p>

    <h3>Source code</h3>

    <p>
        You can get the source code for v13 <a href="http://grislygrotto.blob.core.windows.net/usercontentpub/gg13src.zip">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        For v13 the usernames/passwords are hard coded in a user class rather than being stored somewhere (I have reasons!) - this has been updated with dummy users. I have also removed the app keys for azure, which you will need to sort if you want to set this up. I dont know why you would want to do that, but if you do then hopefully what you need to do can be easily figured out from the code base.
