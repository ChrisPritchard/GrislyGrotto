<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
My name is Christopher Pritchard, and I work as a security consultant at <a href="https://www.aurainfosec.com/">Aura Information Security</a> in Wellington, New Zealand / Aotearoa. Aside from infosec, most of my career has been in Software Development and Solution Architecture roles. Going on seventeen years now, phew.
</p>
<p>
Enough about work though! Outside of my life as a wage slave, my hobbies are writing (I do <a href="https://nanowrimo.org">NaNoWriMo</a> every year, lots of fun), gaming (on PC, more or less exclusively), coding (including fun comps like <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a>) and hacking (CTFs like on <a href="https://tryhackme.com/p/Aquinas/">TryHackMe</a> - nothing <i>illegal</i>). I also do a lot of personal projects, such as the one you are looking at now - more can be found on my GitHub profile linked below.
</p>
<p>
Oh, I am also a happily married man with a young daughter. I also have a small dog who for some fucking reason won't shut up whenever a door slams.

<h2>About the Grisly Grotto</h2>
<p>The Grisly Grotto is the personal blogging site of myself and Pete. The name comes from a computer game, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(video_game)">Quake</a> (from 1996!) which was a formative game in my childhood. Specifically the fourth level of the first 'episode' in Quake, <a href="https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/E1M4:_the_Grisly_Grotto">E1M4: 'The Grisly Grotto'</a>. I don't know; I liked the name, and so its stuck for the past fourteen years. I can't actually remember why I initially chose it ðŸ¤”.</p>
<p>
The first version of GG went live back in 2006. I had always wanted to have a blog, and thought having one was part of what made someone a developer.
More importantly though, while I had learned a few web development skills (in ASP.NET Webforms back then), my day job did not afford me the opportunity to 'do it all': design, development, hosting, bug fixing etc. 
So GG was born, a web application of manageable scope that allowed me to fully practice my craft. 
While I have outgrown whats required to make something as simple as blog, it still serves as a periodic 'zen' meditation: rebuilding the same structure over and over again, in the latest JS framework, database architecture or server-side technology that takes my fancy.
</p>
<p>
So far there have been 17 versions, made in a variety of languages and techniques. Earlier versions used ASP.NET Webforms, some used XSLT transforms for markup, some were pure client side javascript and there was a one-off version in NodeJS, though most have been partly or entirely .NET code. 
Multiple design frameworks have been used, but mostly I have done the CSS entirely myself for practice. At least six different data storage solutions (databases or otherwise) have been used, and multiple different hosting solutions including paid hosting, Azure, AWS and even for a few versions on a Raspberry PI 3B+ in a desk drawer.
</p>
<p>
I expect there to be many more iterations as I seek to learn new things going forward.

<h2>About v17 specifically</h2>
<p>
v17 is the first version to be built in the language Go, and a reasonably anaemic use of the language too: aside from a couple of libraries for Sqlite and markdown, I am using nothing but the packages shipped with the core install (mainly http, database/sql and template/html). The previous two versions of the website were in F# (though in truth largely the same codebase), a language that is one of my favourites for its simplicity and functional style. However, I have really enjoyed building this version in Go.
</p>
<p>
Why use Go? I use it at work, in my infosec job. Its simplicity and the fact it builds to a nice small, fast executable is very useful for the point work I use it for. I decided to see how easy it would be to use it for web sites, and when I discovered <i>how</i> easy it would be, I thought I would have a go at building my standing 'kata' project: this site. I am glad I did.
</p>
<p>
Hosting wise, the site <i>was</i> running on a small <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/">Raspberry PI 3 B+</a>, with no issues, however eventually some port forwarding problems started to crop up with my home network and the cost of my static IP grew annoying. So, subsequently, it was moved to a micro EC2 instance in AWS running Ubuntu 18. GG is started via a system service, sits behind a reverse proxy (nginx), and enforces HTTPS via a <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">LetsEncrypt</a> certificate. Very nice.
</p>
<p>The source code for the site is <a href="https://github.com/ChrisPritchard/GrislyGrotto">here</a>, do with as you will.</p>
<p>
Cheers.
